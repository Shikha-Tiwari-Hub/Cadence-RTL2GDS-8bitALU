# Cadence-RTL2GDS-8bitALU
This project demonstrates a complete **RTL-to-GDSII** flow for an **8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using **Cadence tools**.\
It covers the full **ASIC physical design process**, from Verilog RTL to final GDSII layout.

# Prerequisites
Before starting the RTL-to-GDS flow, ensure you have the following:
## Tools
* Cadence Genus (for RTL Synthesis)
* Cadence Innovus (for Physical Design)
## Libraries
* Standard Cell Library (example: 180nm SCL PDK, or your college-provided library)
* Technology LEF files (```*.lef```)
* Liberty timing files (`*.lib`)

# RTL-to-GDSII Flow
1. RTL Design
2. Logic Synthesis
3. Physical Design
   * Floorplanning
   * Power Planning
   * Placement
   * Placement
   * Routing
   * STA, DRC, LVS
   * GDSII Export
